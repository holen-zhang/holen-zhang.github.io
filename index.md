## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Software Engineering at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). Advised by Professor [Weiyi Shang](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wshang/), my research interests include Software Testing, GUI Testing, Software Logging, and Software Performance.

In addition to my research, I am a research intern at [ERA Environmental Software Solutions](https://www.era-environmental.com/). My work there involves projects related to Playwright/Selenium test generation and repair, LLM-based web agents, and CI pipelines.
